# Practices of An Agile Developer, Working in the Real World   *By Venkat Subramaniam and Andy Hunt*

## Chapter 1: Agile Software Development
* Software development is more like surfing, it's a dynamic, every changing environment.
* Your software project depends on the skills, training and competence of all the developers on the team.
* Software is never really **done** as long as people continue to use it.
* You want to tackle small problems while they are still small, explore the unknown before you invest too much in it, and **be prepared to admit you got it all wrong as soon as you discover the truth**.
* Agile development uses feedback to make constant adjustment in a highly collaborative environment.

#### The Agile manifesto
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation.
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
4. Responding to change over following a plan.

> While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
## Chapter 2: Begining Agility
> *He who chooses the beginning of a road chooses the place it leads to.*
* Software development dosen't happen in a chart, an IDE, or a design tool; it happens in your head.
* A professional attitude focuses on positive outcomes for the project and the team.
### 1. Work for Outcome
* In an agile team, the focus is on outcomes. You want to focus on fixing the problem, instead of affixing the blame. *Blame dosen't fix bugs*.
* If you go to an agile team member with a complaint, you'll hear *"Ok what can I do to help you with this?*.
* *Blame dosen't fix bugs* Instead of pointing fingers, point to possible solutions. It's the positive outcomes that counts.

### 2: Quick fixes become Quicksand
* Beware of land mines.
* Isolation is dangerous; don't let your developers write code in complete isolation.
* Use unit tests(executable Documentation).
* Don't fall for the quick hack. Invest the energy to keep code clean & out in the open.
* Fix the problem not the symptom.

### 3. Criticize Ideas, not people.
* No accusation, no judgement, just a simple clarification.
* Negativity kills innovation - negative comments & attitudes kills innovation.
* Focus on solving problems rather than trying to prove whose idea is better.
* Design( and life, for that matter) is full of compromises. A winning team is the one that realizes this fact.
* Take pride in arriving at a solution rather than proving whose idea is better.

> You don't have to be great to get started, but you have to get started to be great - Les brown.  
> It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.

### 4. Damn the Torpedoes, Go Ahead.
* Sometimes the best plans fails in the absence of courage. Despite the dangers - the real & metaphorical torpedoes - you need to charge ahead and do what's right.
* *Do what's right* - be honest, and have the courage to communicate the truth. It may be difficult at times; that's why it takes courage.

## Chapter 3: Feeding Agility
> Even if you are on the right track, you will get run over if you just sit there - Will Rogers.
* Being in the software profession is a bit like being on a threadmil - you have to keep up with the pace, or you'll be thrown off. It's up to you to keep up with change.
* Investing in keeping yourself up to date is a great start, but you also need to make an effort to Invest in your Team.

### 5. Keep up with change
> There is nothing permanent except change - Heraclitus.
1. Learn Iteratively and incrementally
2. Get the latest buzz - Tech Blogs, Pragmatic programmer.com
3. Attend local user groups.
4. Attend workshops or conferences
5. Read voracioiusly - Find good books on software development and non-technical topics.

You don't have to become an expert at everything, but stay aware of where the industry is headed, and plan your career and projects accordingly.

### 6. Invest in your team
* On a team, it's not enough if you personally know a lot.
* Find areas where you, or someone in your team who is knowledgeable, can help the rest of the team come up to speed.
* Each week, ask one member of your team to lead the discussion.

> Raise the bar for you & your team - use brown-bag sessions to increase everyone's knowledge and skills and help bring people together. Get the team excited about technologies or techniques that will benefit your project.

### 7. Know when to unlearn.
* Given the change is so constant and pervasive, does it make any sense to keep applying the same techniques and tools you've always used?

* Expensive mental models aren't discarded lightly
    > Old habits are hard to break and even harder to notice.  
    > The first step to unlearning is to realize that you're using an outdated approach.  
    > The other part is letting go

Learn the new; unlearn the old - when learning a new technology unlearn any old habits that might hold you back. After all, there's much more to a car than just a horseless carriage.
